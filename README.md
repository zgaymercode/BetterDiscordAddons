# The end of the line
## We succeeded in keeping this plugin alive and created a community that is free from Discord-imposed censorship in official BD channels.

## Mistakes were made on all sides, but I think ultimately everyone can be happy with the end result.
# Thank all of you for being a part of this!
## Join the relevant channels and you'll find more than enough much improved forks: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenBetterDiscord/) & [Discord](https://discord.gg/e66JbKte2P)
